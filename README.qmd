Example GitHub Action workflow to generate developmental webR/R WASM Package binaries

# Overview

Interested in having your R package automatically be built for [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) through
a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions)? 
If so, this is the repository for you! Here's a summary of what you can find in the repository:

- [`.github/workflows/deploy-cran-repo.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-cran-repo.yml):
  Modified version of [`r-wasm/actions`' deploy-cran-repo.yml](https://github.com/r-wasm/actions/blob/d21bf7da50e539df543bbee973087ec585deaba6/examples/deploy-cran-repo.yml)
- [`DESCRIPTION`](DESCRIPTION): 
  Standard description information for an R package
- [`R/in-webr.R`](R/in-webr.R): Check to see if we're inside of webR or not.

You can view the pushed webR package binary parts by looking at the
[`gh-pages`](https://github.com/coatless-tutorials/webr-github-action-wasm-binaries/tree/gh-pages)
branch of the repository. Specifically, we can see binary package data [`bin/emscripten/contrib/4.3`](https://github.com/coatless-tutorials/webr-github-action-wasm-binaries/tree/gh-pages/bin/emscripten/contrib/4.3)
and the package information in
[`src/contrib`](https://github.com/coatless-tutorials/webr-github-action-wasm-binaries/tree/gh-pages/src/contrib). You can read more about package repositories that
are CRAN-like in the [R Administration: 6.6 Setting up a package repository](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Setting-up-a-package-repository).

## Setup

You can re-create the necessary parts to automatically compile
R WASM package binaries and make them available on GitHub Pages with:

```r
if(!requireNamespace("usethis", quietly = TRUE)) {install.packages("usethis")}


# Ensure GitHub Pages is setup
usethis::use_github_pages()

# Obtain the modified version of the rwasm repo setup
usethis::use_github_action(
  "https://github.com/coatless-tutorials/webr-github-action-wasm-binaries/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-cran-repo.yml"
)
```

Viola! Binaries will automatically be built on each new commit and published 
on the repository's website served by GitHub Pages.

## Accessing Binaries

Inside of a webR session, you can access the built binaries by using
the repository's GitHub Pages URL, e.g.

```
https://gh-username.github.io/repo-name
```

This can be set either using `options()` or specifying the location in each
`webr::install()` call.

The easiest is probably to define the location webR should search for in
`options()`. 

```r
# Run once at the start of the session
options(
  repos = c("https://gh-username.github.io/repo-name", 
            "https://repo.r-wasm.org/")
)

# Call
webr::install("pkgname")
```

Otherwise, you can specify it each time:

```r
webr::install("pkgname", "https://gh-username.github.io/repo-name")
```

:::{.callout-important}
Please make sure the repository's [GitHub Pages website is available over `HTTPS`](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https#enforcing-https-for-your-github-pages-site) not `HTTP` (notice the lack of an `s`).
You can verify this option was selected by:

1. Going to the repository's **Settings** page
2. Selecting **Pages** under **Code and automation**
3. Checking the **Enforce HTTPS** button.

Otherwise, you will receive the error message of: 

```
Warning: unable to access index for repository http://gh-username.github.io/repo-name/bin/emscripten/contrib/4.3
```
:::

## Verify

Go to the [webR REPL Editor](https://webr.r-wasm.org/v0.2.2/) (pinned to v0.2.2)
and run the following:

```r
# Check if package `{demorwasmbinary}` is installed
"demorwasmbinary" %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"]
# Install the binary from a repository
webr::install(
  "demorwasmbinary", 
  repos = "https://tutorials.thecoatlessprofessor.com/webr-github-action-wasm-binaries/"
)
# Check to see if the function works
demorwasmbinary::in_webr()
# View help documentation
?demorwasmbinary::in_webr
```

You should receive:
